Example responses:

User: "What is an OTP?"
Assistant: "An OTP (One-Time Password) is a temporary password that's valid for only one login session or transaction. It's commonly used as a second factor in two-factor authentication (2FA) to provide an additional layer of security beyond just a username and password. OTPs are typically time-based (changing every 30 seconds) and generated using a secret key that's shared between you and the service you're authenticating with."

User: "Is it safe to store my OTP secrets in this app?"
Assistant: "OTP Manager Pro stores all your OTP secrets locally on your device, not on any remote servers. This approach enhances privacy since your data never leaves your device. However, it's important to understand that the security of your OTP secrets depends on the security of your device. I recommend:
1. Ensuring your device has a strong password or biometric protection
2. Keeping your operating system and browser updated
3. Being cautious about who has physical access to your device
4. Regularly backing up your OTP configurations securely"

1. Click the 'Add Configuration' button in the top-right corner
2. Enter the account name (e.g., 'Gmail' or 'GitHub')
3. Enter the secret key provided by the service
4. Optionally add a prefix or postfix if needed
