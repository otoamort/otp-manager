# OTP Manager Pro - Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in OTP Manager Pro to protect One-Time Password (OTP) secrets and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data.

## Security Architecture

OTP Manager Pro is designed with a security-first approach, implementing multiple layers of protection to safeguard sensitive authentication data.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Security

OTP Manager Pro stores all configuration data in the browser's local storage. This approach offers several security benefits:

1. **No Server Storage**: OTP secrets are never transmitted to or stored on any server, eliminating the risk of server-side breaches.
2. **Device Isolation**: Data remains isolated to the specific device and browser where it was created.
3. **Origin Binding**: Browser local storage is bound to the specific origin (domain), preventing access from other websites.

### Data Encryption

While the current implementation stores data in local storage without additional encryption, the application is designed to support encryption in future updates. The planned encryption approach will:

1. Use the Web Crypto API for standards-based cryptographic operations
2. Implement AES-GCM encryption for all stored secrets
3. Derive encryption keys from user-provided passwords using PBKDF2 with appropriate iteration counts

## Authentication Security

### TOTP Implementation

The application implements Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) generation according to RFC 6238:

1. **Standard Compliance**: Follows industry standards for TOTP generation
2. **Time Synchronization**: Uses the device's system time for TOTP calculation
3. **Configurable Parameters**: Supports customization of TOTP parameters (period, digits, algorithm)

### Secret Handling

OTP secrets are handled with care throughout the application:

1. **Masked Display**: OTP codes are hidden by default and only shown on explicit user action
2. **Memory Management**: Sensitive data is not unnecessarily duplicated in memory
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks

## User Interface Security

### Clipboard Protection

When copying OTP codes to the clipboard:

1. **Automatic Clearing**: Future versions will implement automatic clipboard clearing after a configurable timeout
2. **Visual Indicators**: Users are notified when an OTP code is in the clipboard

### Visual Security

The UI is designed to minimize the risk of shoulder surfing:

1. **Hidden OTP Codes**: Codes are masked by default
2. **Minimal Exposure**: OTP codes are only displayed when explicitly requested by the user
3. **Auto-Hide**: Future versions will implement automatic hiding of OTP codes after a timeout

## Import/Export Security

### Backup File Security

When exporting OTP configurations:

1. **User Warnings**: Users are warned about the sensitivity of exported data
2. **Format Integrity**: Export files use a consistent JSON format that maintains data integrity
3. **Future Encryption**: Future versions will implement password-protected encrypted export files

## QR Code Security

### Camera Access

When scanning QR codes:

1. **Permission Based**: Camera access requires explicit user permission
2. **Local Processing**: QR codes are processed entirely on the client side
3. **No Storage**: Camera frames are not stored or transmitted

### Image Upload

When uploading QR code images:

1. **Local Processing**: Images are processed entirely in the browser
2. **No Storage**: Uploaded images are not stored or transmitted
3. **Memory Management**: Image data is removed from memory after processing

## Future Security Enhancements

The following security enhancements are planned for future releases:

1. **Encryption**: Implement encryption for all stored OTP secrets
2. **Biometric Authentication**: Add support for biometric authentication (where available)
3. **Password Protection**: Add application-level password protection
4. **Session Timeouts**: Implement automatic session expiration after a period of inactivity
5. **Secure Backup**: Implement encrypted, password-protected backup files
6. **Audit Logging**: Add optional logging of security-relevant events
7. **Integrity Verification**: Add integrity checks for stored data

## Security Best Practices for Users

Users are encouraged to follow these security best practices:

1. **Device Security**: Ensure your device is secured with a strong password or biometric authentication
2. **Browser Security**: Keep your browser updated to the latest version
3. **Private Browsing**: Consider using private/incognito mode when accessing the application on shared devices
4. **Regular Backups**: Export your configurations regularly and store the backup securely
5. **Secure Export Files**: Store exported configuration files in a secure location
6. **Screen Privacy**: Be aware of your surroundings when viewing OTP codes

## Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in OTP Manager Pro, please report it responsibly by:

1. Creating an issue in the GitHub repository
2. Providing detailed information about the vulnerability
3. If possible, suggesting a mitigation or fix

## Conclusion

OTP Manager Pro is designed with security as a primary concern. While no system can guarantee absolute security, the application implements multiple layers of protection to safeguard sensitive authentication data. Future updates will continue to enhance the security posture of the application.
